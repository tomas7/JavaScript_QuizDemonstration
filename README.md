# JavaScript_QuizDemonstration
This is a small project made only for purpose of personal practice. I put the main emphasis on JavaScript as programming language where styling in CSS was not important here. 1. Read the question and try to answer. You have a text field where you have to type a number of the question you think is correct (Fx.: "0"). 2. Don`t forget to see the video after you respond. There are about 3 questions which are pretty interesting, try to guess the answer and check the video as the correct answer will be clear after watching it.
