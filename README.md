# About this project

This is a small project made only for purpose of personal practice. I put the main emphasis on JavaScript as programming language where styling in CSS was not important here.

##Instructions:

### 1. Read the question and try to answer. You have a text field where you have to type a number of the question you think is correct (Fx.: "0").

### 2. Don`t forget to see the video after you respond.

##Some features:

### JS basic and more advanced features from DOM manipulation to IFIS

### Interesting fun facts

 work is still in progress and there are some extra re-renders I will take care in near future.
